MatlabLiveWire
==============

LiveWire on matlab. 
Using IvusSnakes (http://ivussnakes.sourceforge.net/) ImageJ plugin to do the calculations. 
The initial version was a port of the aforementioned plugin, but it was too slow for any useful application (removed at f33a5a6 commit) and I went back to using Java to do the hard lifting.

A work in progress...
